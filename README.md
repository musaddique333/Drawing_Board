## Description 📝

The Drawing Board is a web-based creative platform that allows users to unleash their artistic talents. This project offers an interactive canvas where you can draw, paint, and express your creativity.

## What I Learned 🧠

Throughout the development of the Drawing Board project, I gained valuable knowledge and practical experience, including:

1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: I strengthened my skills in web development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive canvas and user-friendly interface.

2. **User Interaction**: I learned how to handle user interactions, such as mouse clicks and drags, to enable drawing and erasing functionality.

3. **Dynamic Elements**: I became proficient in dynamically updating the canvas, adjusting its size, and changing colors in real-time.

4. **UI Design**: I explored UI design concepts to make the Drawing Board visually appealing and easy to use.

5. **GitHub Collaboration**: I gained experience in collaborating on GitHub, managing issues, and accepting contributions from other developers.
